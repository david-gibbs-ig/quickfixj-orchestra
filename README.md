# fix-orchestra-quickfix

![](FIXorchestraLogo.png)

This project contains integrations between FIX Orchestra and QuickFIX.

* FIX Orchestra is intended to provide a standard and some reference implementation for *machine readable rules of engagement* between counterparties. 

* QuickFIX is a popular, open-source FIX engine. It has been implemented or ported to several programming languages, including C++, Java, .NET, and golang.

The code is based on prior work by the FTC, see [fix-orchestra-quickfix](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra-quickfix). Accordingly the Apache 2.0 license is applicable.

It was agreed that the code be moved to this repository for the following reasons :
* to establish curation of the code base and tools for easier customisation of QuickFIX/J for specific Rules of Engagement
* the code generation is coupled to the QuickFIX/J implementation therefore its "reason to change" is when the QuickFIX/J implementation changes

## Modules

### quickfixj-orchestra

The parent module is implemented to serve as a parent for potential future QuickFIX/J work based on FIX Orchestra. 
Two modules from the original FIX Trading Community [fix-orchestra-quickfix](https://github.com/FIXTradingCommunity/fix-orchestra-quickfix) project are not included in this build
as they would introduce a cyclic dependency with the QuickFIX/J project. These modules could be implemented in a 
separate repository in the future but use `quickfixj-orchestra` as a parent pom. 

### quickfixj-from-fix-orchestra-repository

This module provides tools to generate QuickFIX artefacts from an Orchestra repository file. 

This includes :
* QuickFIX Dictionary generation that can be consumed by the C++, Java and .NET versions. Although the QuickFIX data dictionary is not as richly featured as Orchestra, it is hoped that this utility will help with Orchestra adoption. 
* Generation of Field and Message classes for QuickFIX/J directly from an Orchestra file.
* Mvn plugins to facilitate the above
