# repository-to-quickfixj

![](../../FIXorchestraLogo.png)

This module provides both QuickFIX/J Dictionary and code generation given a FIX Orchestra repository file.

This method of code generation is faster than the xslt transformations used to build from QuickFIX/J dictionary specifications.
It was not possible to meet build time constraints using the XSLT approach when building the complete FIX Latest standard for QuickFIX/J.
